# A Makefile for everything and everything is make

Since time immemorial (80's?) make has simplified building large, complex projects with hundreds of source files across several levels of nested directories with parallelism, configurability and unprecedented User Experience.

## Is make still relevant in 2021?

Yes. Very much so. The flexibility, simplicity and versatility of `make` is on par with modern build systems like `gradle` and `maven` and far easier to set up than native language packaging like `npm`, `composer` or `PyPI`. I, personally, use Makefiles extensively in my projects to have a similar interface across projects with the ability to define what exactly it means to *build* in each project.

## Is it hard?

No. It is deceptively simple, in fact. You can build complexity through recursivity and parallelism and achieve, essentially, any desierd outcome. In my experience, it makes going back to a project much easier and provides a **working-code-as-documentation** drop in replacement for good chunk of the `README.md`.

There are good tutorials and the documentation is extensive. In my experience, however, it is far more effective a way to learn to take existing Makefiles and adapt them slowly until you understand what each part of the file does.
